# Testing Environment Setup Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Installed Testing Libraries**
   - Vitest for unit and integration testing
   - Playwright for E2E testing
   - Testing Library for React component testing
   - MSW for API mocking

2. **Set Up Vitest Configuration**
   - Created `vitest.config.ts` with proper settings
   - Set up test environment with JSDOM
   - Configured coverage reporting
   - Added global test setup in `tests/setup.ts`

3. **Set Up Playwright Configuration**
   - Created `playwright.config.ts` with Chromium-only settings
   - Set up screenshot and trace capturing
   - Configured the dev server for testing

4. **Implemented Page Object Model for E2E Testing**
   - Created `e2e/page-objects/home-page.ts` as an example
   - Added a sample E2E test in `e2e/home.spec.ts`

5. **Added Mock Service Worker for API Mocking**
   - Set up handlers in `src/mocks/handlers.ts`
   - Created browser setup in `src/mocks/browser.ts`
   - Added a sample API test

6. **Created Sample Tests**
   - Unit test for React component: `src/components/Auth.test.tsx`
   - Unit test for service with API mocking: `src/lib/services/__tests__/openrouter.service.test.ts`
   - MSW example test: `tests/msw-handlers-example.test.ts`

7. **Added Test Documentation**
   - Created `tests/README.md` with detailed testing documentation
   - Updated project README with new testing scripts

## Known Issues

1. **MSW Setup Challenges**
   - Current version of MSW (v2) has some configuration challenges
   - `onUnhandledRequest: 'bypass'` doesn't work as expected
   - Standalone example provided for reference

2. **Playwright E2E Testing**
   - Tests require the dev server to be running
   - First screenshot test will always fail (baseline needs to be created)

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Component Tests**
   - Add tests for core components
   - Implement test coverage requirements

2. **Expand E2E Test Suite**
   - Add tests for critical user flows
   - Implement more page objects for different pages

3. **Set Up CI Testing**
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Add test reporting to CI pipeline

4. **Fix MSW Configuration Issues**
   - Investigate and fix MSW v2 configuration
   - Create more comprehensive API mocking examples
